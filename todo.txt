Basic Ising model implemented.

Model refinement:
- Pinning transition rates of "mirrored states"
- Altering rates as a function of real genomic distance between methylation sites? Could assume some simple functional form.

Analysis:
- Simulating 'reads' (i.e. given a set of start and end-points, spit out the methylation state at the end of the simulation)
- Measuring instances of various features of methylation. e.g. the local 'states', global methylation rate, binning into chunks and taking averages etc. etc.

Fitting?
- ABC method to fit transition rates to the measured reads for a given sequence. Probably best to do this via the instances of 'states' in individual reads, or concocting some measure of the 'distance' between a real read and a simulated one (or rather a set of real reads and a set of simulated ones).
-->> no real experience here on this front...
